In the DoraHacks challenge, a QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator) was implemented using IBM quantum machines and Qiskit. By applying Hadamard gates, qubits were placed in superposition to generate random bit strings. These QRNG data were combined with PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator) data to compare quantum and classical randomness. The machine learning model was designed to classify QRNG and PRNG bit strings using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RandomForest, with Logistic Regression as a meta-learner. The data underwent preprocessing, including normalization and stratified splitting. After training, the model's performance was evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Randomness quality was further verified using tests like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Linear Complexity test. The results showed that the QRNG data had high entropy and randomness, making it suitable for cryptographic applications. The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of combining quantum computing and machine learning. This provided a deeper understanding of quantum randomness and its potential in secure technologies.
